## Learning Goals

We mostly learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and how they all work together to build a webpage. We made us of Javascript's querySelectors and eventListeners, as well as CSS's flex-box.

## Wins + Challenges

I feel really good about working with flex-box and manipulating elements in the DOM with javascript. I had a bit of trouble with the unmotivational posters duplicating every time the user opened the page but was able to nail down the problem fairly quickly.
